# The Educational Opportunity Monitoring Project

_Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis_

This repository recreates the interactive graphics depicting trends in racial and ethnic achievement gaps for all 50 states, and how the gaps relate to socioeconomic inequalities between groups. The live graphics can be accessed on the [project site](https://cepa.stanford.edu/educational-opportunity-monitoring-project/achievement-gaps/race/). The underlying data was created by the team at the [Stanford Education Data Archive](https://cepa.stanford.edu/seda/data-archive).
